psynote:
Hey uh so I moved all the resources into the game folder -- although in release
distributions they'll probably be all bundled up into one jar, it's much easier
to run the game in its own resources folder... this may change as we get further
into the development process

So now this folder represents all resources that should be used to make the shit
associated with the game, including tilesets and whatever miscellaneous tools
come to mind
