OPTIONAL MANUAL:

Background:

Generations ago, a gate in the city of Hero opened to reveal a new world beyond.
Scholars and traders emerged from the gate, bearing new sciences and magical
artifacts.

A year later, the world behind the gate changed. Hoards of monsters poured out
of the gate and ransacked the countryside. The wisemen from the gate were seen
no more. In desperation, the gate was sealed and the town abandoned.

The legend of Hero was not forgotten. Dreaming of the world beyond the gate,
many have sought the secret city of Hero, but none have returned. Now, another
tale of adventure is about to begin...

Party:

Recruit four party members to face the world beyond Hero.

Humans carry 8 items and excel at single target weapon damage. They grow by
drinking special potions. Humans cannot use magic.

Mutants carry 4 items and excel at group target magic. They naturally mutate
after battle, gaining stats and abilities.

Monsters carry no items but are very versatile. They transform by eating other
monsters. Eating the meat of much stronger monsters often results in a better
transformation.

Robots carry 8 items. Robots only receive half the item uses as other races but
recharge their uses when they heal. Robots do not grow naturally, but they gain
stats according to their equipped items.

New players are advised to pick a mix of races. Enemies in SaGa are quite
threatening and the party's objective should be to kill as many as possible
before they can act. If one character is assigned to attack an enemy that is
already dead, they will not automatically pick a new target. Therefore, assign
targets wisely to finish the battle in one combat round.
