v1.20

Balance:
  - Buffed the SPEED staff (bigger agi boost)
  - Heavily nerfed the HEAL staff (not as heavily influence by mana, it was
    previously healing about twice what it should've been)
  - Increased the price of the DRAGON helm, SAMURAI guantlet, and DRAGON body
    (the resistances they offer are substantial)
  - Buffed the EXIT spell (hits more often)
  - Tweaked the HEAL spell (it was previously worse than the more mundane staff)
  - Tweaked the BAND helm (it offers a bit less defense but true to its SaGa1
    counterpart, it confers O-PARA)
  - Buffed the NUKE spell
  - Buffed the LASER bow
  - Buffed the PETRIFY hammer
  - Buffed the GREAT bow
  - Buffed the LMG gun
  - Buffed the TANK gun
  - Buffed the armored beetle class of monsters (better physical tanking)
  - O-ALL no longer includes phys damage resist (it was previously the only
    available to players and made mutants that stumbled on it invincible)
  - Corrected the description of O-PARA (it doesn't actually confer O-STONE)
