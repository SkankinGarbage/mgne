TO RUN:
You should be fine to just double-click Rainfall.jar. If something goes wrong
and you're on Windows, run PlayRainfall.bat. If you're on something else, run
Rainfall.jar either by double clicking it or java -jar Rainfall.jar and then
crossing your fingers. Let me know if you have trouble on a specific OS.

REPORTING PROBLEMS:
If the game crashes, it will provide an info.log and an error.log. Send these
to me at psy_wombats@wombatrpgs.net. Actually it'll probably produce these
anyway. Ignore them if there's no crash or error.

WARNING:
This is not the working version of the game, only an exported copy. This is
autogenerated and if you change any assets, they'll just get overwritten by the
versions from git when I run the export script. So don't fool around in the
internal folders if you care about the changes.
