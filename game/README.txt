TO RUN:
If you're on Windows, run Rainfall.exe. If you're on something else, run
Rainfall.jar either by double clicking it or java -jar Rainfall.jar and then
crossing your fingers. Let me know if you have trouble on a specific OS.

REPORTING PROBLEMS:
If the game crashes, it will provide an info.log and an error.log. Send these
to me at psy_wombats@wombatrpgs.net. If you notice something odd, post it in the
bugs doc ( http://goo.gl/KBMhO ) in the Incoming section, or just get in touch.

That should be it. Happy bug hunting!
