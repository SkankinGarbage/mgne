TO RUN:
You should be fine to just double-click Rainfall.jar. If something goes wrong
and you're on Windows, run PlayRainfall.bat. If you're on something else, run
Rainfall.jar either by double clicking it or java -jar Rainfall.jar and then
crossing your fingers. Let me know if you have trouble on a specific OS.

PROBLEMS:
Normally I'd put what to do with bug reports here but if the project's dead I'm
not bugfixing it. If you're curious, the game generates an error.log and an
info.log every time it runs. What went wrong will probably show up in there.
Probably.

CONTROLS:
Arrow keys and zxcv. Specifically, hold z to run, x to roll, c to attack. Z is
primary confirm key, not that there's any UI.

ADDITIONAL:
I probably wrote some huge post about this release, buut I haven't done it yet
so check twitter for details probably, @psy_wombats .
