TO RUN:
You should be fine to just double-click MRogue.jar. If something goes wrong
and you're on Windows and have your java path set up, PlayMRogue.bat will also
work but that's a bit unlikely. So just cross your fingers and hope running the
jar works. Java will probably need to be up to date (java 7).

REPORTING PROBLEMS:
If the game crashes, it will provide an info.log and an error.log. Send these
to me at psy_wombats@wombatrpgs.net. Actually it'll probably produce these
anyway. Ignore them if there's no crash or error.

WARNING:
This is not the working version of the game, only an exported copy. This is
autogenerated and if you change any assets, they'll just get overwritten by the
versions from git when I run the export script. So don't fool around in the
internal folders if you care about the changes. Once I get a solid hold on
things I'll actually start working from Dropbox and everyone can mess around
with the database editor and break stuff and it'll be awesome.

SO FAR:
Well uh so far there's a map thing and you can move. I'm still overhauling the
engine from an ABS to a dungeon crawl. If that sounds crazy it's because it is.
Oh, there's a narrator and a cool formal AI system now.
